# House_Price_Prediction-using_-Linear_Regression-

Your friend is a real estate agent and wants some help predicting housing prices. It would be great if you could somehow create a model for her that allows her to put in a few features of a house and returns back an estimate of what the house would sell for.

She has asked you if you could help her out with your new data science skills. You say yes, and decide that Linear Regression might be a good path to solve this problem!

Your friend then gives you some information about a bunch of houses,it is all in the data set: Housing.csv.

The data contains the following columns:

'Area': Areaa of the house 
'Stories'
'Bathrooms': Number of Bathrooms for Houses in same city
'Bedrooms': Number of Bedrooms for Houses in same city
'Parking'
'Price': Price that the house sold at
